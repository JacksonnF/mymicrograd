# MyMicrograd

An implementation of Karpathys micrograd in c++. 

Future Plans:
- Transition to using Tensors.
- Add other network architectures (RNN, Transformer etc.).
- Implement more interesting optimizers (Adam etc.) and other concepts like L2 normalization etc.
- Clean up code.
- Experiment with different design paradigms.
